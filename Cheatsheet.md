## JavaScript

### Pattern Declaration

In JavaScript, you can define regex patterns using **single-, double-quoted, or template strings**. An alternative to strings is **RegExp instances**, that can be declared using the **RegExp Constructor** or the **literal notation**(double forward slash).

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

// Regex Literal 
const thePattern = /the/

// RegExp Instance
const thePattern1 = new RegExp("the")
const thePattern2 = new RegExp(thePattern)
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### `String.match(pattern):`

It Tries to match the pattern on the target string. This method returns **null** if none (or an array) is found. If you are applying the global flag to the expression, the content of the array will be all the captured occurrences; if not, the array will contain a single match along with additional information about the captured value, such as its index, groups, and the targeted string.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /the/
console.log(sentence.match(pattern));
```

#### `String.split(pattern):`

This method splits the string and returns an array containing the splitted values. The separator parameter determines the positions where the string will be splitted. This parameter can be either a string, or a regular expression. On the example below, we're separating the string on each vowel.

> **ðŸ‘€ Observation**
> 
> Note that the splitted string array **does not** include the separators. 

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const separatorPattern = /[aeiou]/
console.log(sentence.split(separatorPattern));
```

#### `String.replace(pattern, replaceValue):`

This method replaces a value on the string with another; it can be a character, a word or a full sentence. The first parameter(searchValue) can be either a string or a regular expression, which will search for the value or values that will be replaced; the second parameter(replaceValue) is the value that will replace the captured value.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const searchPattern = /o/
console.log(sentence.replace(searchPattern, "i"));
```

#### `RegExp.test(string):`

This method checks if the given string can be matched by the target regular expression and then returns a boolean.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /quick/
console.log(pattern.test(sentence))
```

#### `RegExp.exec(string):`

This method works similarly to the match method, but with a few key differences.

1. It returns only one match, **regardless** of the presence of the global flag.
2. Modifies some properties on the RegExp Instance **after** the match. If you are interested in knowing which values are modified, here's the [documentation link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec#description) for reference. Take a look at the Description section.


```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /o/
const pattern2 = /o/g

// Both produce the same output
console.log(pattern.exec(sentence)) 
console.log(pattern2.exec(sentence))
```

---
## **Go**

### Pattern Declaration

#### **Strings**

Regex patterns in Go can be defined with strings. You can either use regular double-quoted strings(**requires double escaping** just like in JavaScript) or literal strings, which are declared with backticks and **do not require** Double escaping. 

```go
package main

import (****
	"regexp"
)

func main() {
    sentence := "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
	thePattern := `the`
    theSecondPattern := "the"
}
```

#### **Compile & MustCompile**

Alternatives to **standalone** Strings are the **Compile** and **MustCompile** methods. Both expect a double-quoted or literal String pattern, parses it to a RegExp instance, which can then be used against text. 

> **ðŸ“˜ Compile Vs MustCompile**
> 
> There's a slight difference between these two methods: **Compile** returns two values, a regexp instance and an error object, while the **MustCompile** returns only the regexp instance, but panics if something happens in the parsing process.

```go
package main

import (
	"regexp"
)

func main() {
    sentence := "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern := `the`
    
    cRegexpInstance, err := regexp.Compile(pattern)
	mcRegexpInstance2 := regexp.MustCompile(pattern)
}
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

In my opinion, Golang has a really good documentation. In it, you will not only find the methods' signatures but also a well written description along with a simple example. Having said that, there's not much I have to add in this section of our file besides sharing the link for the [**Original RegExp Docs**](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) and strongly recommend that you take a look at it.

## **Java**

[**Java's Official Documentation**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) offers an overview on the comprising parts of the **Regex Package**, along with its supporting flags and metacharacters, and each methods' signatures paired with a concise definition, but unfortunately, it is lacking on simple examples. In this section, we'll be targeting that. 

### Pattern Declaration

Pattern declaration in Java is made with the `Pattern.compile()` method, which expects a **String** as the pattern parameter. 

> **ðŸ‘€ Observation**
>
> Java **does not** have a similar solution to **JavaScript's Template String** or **Golang's Literal String**, so **we must always double escape some metacharacters(e.g shorthands)**. 

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Regex {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("the");
  } 
}
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### compile(String regex, int flags?)

Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern with the given flags.

This method has two parameters:

1. `String regex`: The expression to be compiled
2. `int flags` : The flags that will be applied to the pattern. In Java, the flags are represented as **bitmasks**. For more information on which flags Java Supports, they are listed and described at the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)

This method returns a `Pattern` instance. 


```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Regex {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("the");
  } 
}
```

#### `Pattern.matcher(CharSequence input)`

Creates a `Matcher` that will match a given input against this pattern.

This method has one parameter:

1. `CharSequence input`: The test string

This method returns a new `Matcher` for this pattern.

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Regex {

    public static void main(String args[]) { 
        String ssn = "123-45-7890";
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{3,4}");
        
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(ssn);
    }
}
```

#### `Matcher.matches(String regex, CharSequence input)`

The `Matcher.matches()` is used to match the input sequence against the full text(beginning to end).
More info on [JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/post/java-matcher-matches-method)

This method returns a `boolean`

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Regex {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String ssn = "123-45-7890";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{3,4}");
        
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(ssn);
    System.out.println(matcher.matches()); // true
  } 
}
```

#### `String.split(CharSequence input, int limit)`

Splits a given `String` into an `Array` of substrings, resulting in a new `Array`.

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Regex {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String html = "#001 Desmond#002 Jin#003 Kate#004 Locke";
    String[] value = html.split("#\\d{3} ");
    for (String string : value) {
        System.out.println(string);
    }
  } 
}
```

#### `find(int start)`

Searches for the next subsequence of the input that matches the pattern.

Besides returning a `boolean`, this method also change the values on some properties on the previously initialized `Matcher` instance, such as:

1. `group`
2. `start`
3. `end`

Every new call, moves for the next possible matching subsequence and set new values on the `Matcher` instance, until there's no possible matches, resulting in a `false`.


```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class Regex {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String time = "[06-03-2021 17:08:40]";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d{2}");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(time);
    while(matcher.find()) {
      System.out.println("Matched value: " + matcher.group());
      System.out.println("Start at: " + matcher.start());
      System.out.println("Ends at: " + matcher.end());
    }
  } 
}
```


#### `group()`
As the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#group(int)) states: 
> _"Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match._
> _This method returns a `String`; The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group during the previous match, or null if the group failed to match part of the input."_

This method has two overloads: 
1. `group(int group)`: This parameter represents each group's numbered backreference.
2. `group(String name)`: The `name` parameter can be used to backreference named capturing groups.

## **Python**

### Pattern Declaration
Just like `Go`, in `Python` you can either declare a pattern using the `re.compile()` method which creates a [regular expression object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re-objects), or directly access the `re` module methods passing in the pattern as a `String`.

```python
import re

string_pattern = "((?:T|t)he)"
regex_object = re.compile("((?:T|t)he)")
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### `re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)`

This method searches through the string capturing the first occurence that matches the defined pattern. 

This method returns a [**Match Object**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects) or **None**.

```python
import re

string_pattern = "((?:T|t)he)"
regex_object = re.compile("((?:T|t)he)")

sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"

match_object = re.search(string_pattern, sentence)
# Or...
# match_object = regex_object.search(sentence)

print(match_object)
```

#### `re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)`

This method works similarly to the `re.search()` method. The only difference is that it restricts the search location to the **beginning of the String**.

This method returns a `Match Object` or **None**.

```python
import re

string_pattern = "((?:T|t)he)"
regex_object = re.compile("((?:T|t)he)")

sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"

result = re.match(string_pattern, sentence)
# Or...
# result = regex_object.match(sentence)

print(result)

```
> âš  Keep in mind
> 
> This method will always restrict the search to the beginning of the string. If you need to perform a search at the beginning of each line, use the `re.search()` method along with the `re.MULTILINE` flag.

#### `re.fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0)`

This method returns a `Match Object` if the whole string is matched by the defined pattern. Otherwise, it retursn **None**

```python
import re

string_pattern = "\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"
regex_object = re.compile("\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}")

ssn = "123-45-6789"

result = re.fullmatch(string_pattern, ssn)
# Or...
# result = regex_object.match(sentence)

print(result)
```

#### `re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)`

This method split the String by the occurrÂ­ences of the pattern. Use the `maxplit` parameter to limit the amount of occurences. 

Returns a `List` of all groups.

```python
import re

string_pattern = "[aeiou]"
regex_object = re.compile("[aeiou]")

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

result = re.split(string_pattern, sentence)
# Or...
# result = regex_object.split(sentence)

print(result)
```

#### `re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)`

This method **finds all** occurrences in string and return them as a list of strings.

```python
import re

string_pattern = "((?:T|t)he)"
regex_object = re.compile("((?:T|t)he)")

sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"

result = re.findall(string_pattern, sentence)

print(result)
```

## **Ruby**

### **Pattern Declaration**

```ruby
class Playground

  sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
  pattern = Regexp.new(/((?:T|t)he)/)
  pattern2 = Regexp.compile(/((?:T|t)he)/) # Alias for Regexp.new()
  pattern3 = /((?:T|t)he)/ # puts pattern3.instance_of? Regexp == true
end
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### **`String =~ Regexp`**

The pattern matching operator, matches a regular expression against a string and returns an `Integer` representing the starting position of the match, or `nil` if none was found.

```ruby
class Playground
  pattern = /\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}/
  ssn = "123-45-6789"

  puts ssn =~ pattern # 0
end
```
> ðŸ‘€ Observation
> 
> This value can be stored on a regular variable like so:
> 
> ```ruby
> variable = ssn =~ pattern
> ```
> 
> However, this value has already been stored on the global `$~` variable, and it can also be accessed through the `Regexp.last_match`.

#### **`String.scan(pattern)`**

This method expects a pattern(`String` or `Regexp`) and iterates through in search for a match, returning an `Array` or `nil` if none was found.

```ruby
class Playground
    sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern = /(?:T|t)he/
    results = sentence.scan(pattern)
    print results

    
    sentence.scan(pattern).each do |match|
        puts "Found: #{match}"
    end
end
```

Alternatively, you can use the following syntax as well:

```ruby
class Playground
    sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern = /(?:T|t)he/
    sentence.scan(pattern).each do |match|
        puts "Found: #{match}"
    end
end
```

#### **`Regexp.match(string, start_pos)`**

The Match method matches a pattern against a string capturing the first occurence.

This method returns a `MatchObject` or `nil` if none was found. 

```ruby
class Playground
    sentence = "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern = /(?:T|t)he/
    matchedData = sentence.match(pattern)
    print matchedData
end
```

#### **`MatchData.named_captures()`**

This method returns a `Hash`, pairing the **capturing groups**(keys)  with their respective values. 

```ruby
class Playground
  pattern = /(?<fst>\d{3})-(?<scnd>\d{2})-(?<thrd>\d{4})/
  ssn = "123-45-6789"

  result = pattern.match(ssn)
  result_as_hash = result.named_captures
  print result_as_hash # {"fst"=>"123", "scnd"=>"45", "thrd"=>"6789"}
end
```

Alternatively, you can use this syntax as well:
```ruby
class Playground
  pattern = /(?<fst>\d{3})-(?<scnd>\d{2})-(?<thrd>\d{4})/
  ssn = "123-45-6789"

  result_as_hash = result.named_captures

  result_as_hash.each do |key, value|
      puts "#{key}: #{value}"
  end
  # fst: 123
  # scnd: 45
  # thrd: 6789
end
```

#### **`MatchData[]`**

Using this operator you have access to the matched data. Pass numbers for numbered backreference, or the capturing group name preceded by a colon. 

```ruby
class Playground
    pattern = /(?<fst>\d{3})-(?<scnd>\d{2})-(?<thrd>\d{4})/
    ssn = "123-45-6789"

    result = pattern.match(ssn)
    puts "Full Match: #{result[0]}"
    puts "First Group: #{result[1]}"
    puts "Second Group: #{result[2]}"
    puts "Thrid Group: #{result[3]}"
    
    puts "Named Backreference: #{result[:fst]}"
end
```


#### **`String.sub(pattern, replaceValue)`**

The `sub` method is the equivalent to  JavaScript's `String.prototype.replace()` method. The first parameter can be either a `Regexp` pattern or a `String` and the second parameter is the replace value.

```ruby
class Playground
    sentence = "The quick brown fox, jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern = /the/i
    puts sentence.sub(pattern, "THE")
    # THE quick brown fox, jumped over the lazy dog
end
```

Notice that it only replaced the first occurence of the word **the**. The `sub` method only replaces the first occurence, and since Ruby(2.7.x) **does not** support the **global flag**, if you ever need to replace all the occurences, you need to use the gsub method.
