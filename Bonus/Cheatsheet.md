## JavaScript

### Pattern Declaration

In JavaScript, you can define regex patterns using **single-, double-quoted, or template strings**. An alternative to strings is **RegExp instances**, that be declared using the **RegExp Constructor** or the **literal notation**(double forwardslash).

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

// Regex Literal 
const thePattern = /the/

// RegExp Instance
const thePattern1 = new RegExp("the")
const thePattern2 = new RegExp(thePattern)
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### `String.match(pattern):`

It Tries to match the pattern on the target string. This method returns **null** if none was found or an array. If you are applying the global flag to the expression, the content of the array will be all the caputered occurences; if not, the array will contain a single match along with aditional informations about the captured value, such as its index, groups, and the targeted string.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /the/
console.log(sentence.match(pattern));
```

#### `String.split(pattern):`

This method splits the string and returns an array containing the splitted values. The separator parameter determines the positions where string will be splitted. This parameter can be either a string, or a regular expression. On the exaple bellow, we're separating the string on each vowel.

> **ðŸ‘€ Observation**
> 
> Note that the splitted string array **does not** include the separators. 

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const separatorPattern = /[aeiou]/
console.log(sentence.split(separatorPattern));
```

#### `String.replace(pattern, replaceValue):`

This method replaces a value on the string with another, it can be a character, a word or a full sentence. The first parameter(searchValue) can be either a string, or a regular expression which will search for the value or values that will be replaced; the second paramenter(replaceValue) is the value that will replace captured value.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const searchPattern = /o/
console.log(sentence.replace(searchPattern, "i"));
```

#### `RegExp.test(string):`

This method checks if the given string can be matched by the target regular expression and returns a boolean.

```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /quick/
console.log(pattern.test(sentence))
```

#### `RegExp.exec(string):`
This method works similarly to the match method, but with a few key differences.

1. It only returns only one match, **regardless** of the presence of the global flag.
2. Modifies some properties on the RegExp Instance after the match. If you are interested in knowing which values are modified, here's the [documentation link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec#description) for reference. Take a look at the Description section.


```js
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
const pattern = /o/
const pattern2 = /o/g

// Both produce the same output
console.log(pattern.exec(sentence)) 
console.log(pattern2.exec(sentence))
```

## **Go**

### Pattern Declaration

#### **Strings**

Regex patterns in Go can be defined with strings. You can either use regular double-quoted strings(**requires double escaping** just like in JavaScript); or literal strings which are declared with backticks, that (**does not require** double escaping). 

```go
package main

import (****
	"regexp"
)

func main() {
    sentence := "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
	thePattern := `the`
    theSecondPattern := "the"
}
```

#### **Compile & MustCompile**

An alternative to Strings is the **Compile** and **MustCompile** methods. Both expect a double-quoted or literal String pattern, parses it to a RegExp instance, which can then be used against text. 

> **ðŸ“˜ Compile Vs MustCompile**
> 
> There's a slight difference between these two methods. **Compile** returns two values, a regexp instance and an error object; while the **MustCompile** returns only the regexp instance, but panics if something happens in the parsing process.

```go
package main

import (
	"regexp"
)

func main() {
    sentence := "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
    pattern := `the`
    
    cRegexpInstance, err := regexp.Compile(pattern)
	mcRegexpInstance2 := regexp.MustCompile(pattern)
}
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

In my opinion, Golang has a really good documentation. There, you will not only find the methods' signatures but also a well written description along with a simple example. With that said, there's not much I have to add in this section of our file besides sharing the link for the [**Original RegExp Docs**](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) and my strong recomendations to take a look at it.

## **Java**

[Java's Official Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) offers an overview on the comprising parts of the **Regex Package**, along with its supporting flags and metacharacters, and each methods' signatures paired with a concise definition, but unfortunately, it lacks on simple examples. In this section, we'll be targeting that. 

### Pattern Declaration

Pattern declaration in Java is made with the `Pattern.compile()` method, which expects a **String** as the pattern parameter. 

> **ðŸ‘€ Observation**
>
> Java **does not** have a similar solution to **JavaScript's Template String or Golang's Literal String**, so **we must always double escape some metacharacters(e.g shorthands)**. 

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class teste {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("the");
  } 
}
```

### **Useful Regex Supporting API methods**

#### compile(String regex, int flags?)
Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern with the given flags.

This method has two parameters:
1. `String regex`: The expression to be compiled
2. `int flags` - The flags that will be applied to the pattern. In Java, the flags are represented as **bitmasks**. For more information on which flags Java Supports, they are listed and described at the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)

This method returns a `Pattern` instance. 


```java
import java.util.regex.*;

class teste {  
  public static void main(String args[]) { 
    String sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("the");
  } 
}
```

#### `Pattern.matcher(String regex, int flags?)`

Creates a `Matcher` that will match the given input against this pattern.

This method returns a new `Matcher` for this pattern.

#### `Matcher.matches(String regex, int flags?)`

Compiles the given regular expression and attempts to match the given input against it.

This method returns a `boolean`; `true` if, and only if, a subsequence of the input sequence matches this matcher's pattern.


#### `String.split(String regex, int flags?)`

Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

This method returns the `Array` of `Strings` computed by splitting the input around matches of this pattern.


#### `find(String regex, int flags?)`

Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.

This method returns a `boolean`; `true` if, and only if, a subsequence of the input sequence starting at the given index matches this matcher's pattern.

#### `group(String regex, int flags?)`

Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.

This method returns a `String`; The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group during the previous match, or null if the group failed to match part of the input.
